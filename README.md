# Undertale Save Manager

This is a program that can organise and backup saves for you using python!

## Installation

Download the most recent release from [here](https://github.com/TheAmazingJeh/Undertale-Save-Manager/releases/latest) and run it in its own folder.

It is still possible to run the `.pyw` version as well if you have python and the relevant modules installed on your computer. To do this, download the source code (.zip) from [here](https://github.com/TheAmazingJeh/Undertale-Save-Manager/releases/latest), extract it and run `main-gui.pyw`.
