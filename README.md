# Undertale Save Manager

This is a program that can organise and backup saves for you using python!

The only versions that are now being updated are `Undertale Save Manager 2.0.exe` and `main-gui.pyw`

## Installation

Download all files and run `Undertale Save Manager 2.0.exe` to start the program.

You can also run `Undertale Save Manager 1.0.exe` to run a command line based program as well.

It is still possible to run the `.py` and `.pyw` versions as well if you have python installed on your computer.
